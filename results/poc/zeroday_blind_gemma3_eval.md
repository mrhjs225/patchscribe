## Case: CWE-125___CVE-2024-25116.c___1-64___13.c
- **Option A** — Score: 2/3  
  Reason: Good structure and mostly accurate, but claims the existing `bucketSize * 2 > capacity` guard as a patch change.
- **Option B** — Score: 2/3  
  Reason: Correctly highlights the new defaults and range checks; clear and complete. Also includes raw code despite the natural-language requirement.
- **Option C** — Score: 2/3  
  Reason: Accurate regarding `maxIterations`, but omits the bucket/expansion guards.
- **Option D** — Score: 1/3  
  Reason: Introduces incorrect assertions about newly added parsing and error handling.
- **Ranking**: B (1st) > A (2nd) > C (3rd) > D (4th)

## Case: CWE-125___CVE-2024-29489.c___1-59___5.c

## Case: CWE-125___CVE-2024-31584.c___1-48___23.c
- **Option A** — Score: 2/3  
  Reason: Captures the extended guard, but overstates the effect on zero-length arrays.
- **Option B** — Score: 1/3  
  Reason: Claims `mobile_ivalue_size_` is always ≥1 after the patch, which is incorrect.
- **Option C** — Score: 1/3

- **Option C** — Score: 3/3  
  Reason: Precisely explains the off-by-one condition and the guard update.
- **Option D** — Score: 3/3  
  Reason: Clear on both the trigger and the mitigation via `buffer_within_range(..., 2, ...)`.
